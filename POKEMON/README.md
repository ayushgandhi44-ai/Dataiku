# Dataiku DSS Projects

On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with downloaded from Kaggle. Installation pretty straght forwad. Simply download the whole set as a single project as a ZIP files, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue.

The software Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) was announced in 2014, supporting predictive modelling to build business applications.[9] Later versions of DSS added other features.Dataiku offers a free edition and enterprise versions with additional features, such as multi-user collaboration or real-time scoring.
