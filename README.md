# Dataiku DSS Projects

On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with downloaded from Kaggle. Installation pretty straight forward. Simply download the whole set as a single project as a ZIP files, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue.


# Installation
You'll be needing one proper installation of Dataiku version 7, PgSQL (due some of the project was running on top of an SQL), running on top of whatever Operating System you're most familar with.

The software Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) was announced in 2014, supporting predictive modelling to build business applications.Later versions of DSS added other features.Dataiku offers a free edition and enterprise versions with additional features, such as multi-user collaboration or real-time scoring.

`***Disclaimer***`: And please remember, as this is only a weekend pet project, I'm doing them for my personal interest only.
